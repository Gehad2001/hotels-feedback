hotels feedback project python
The project idea is to make people who use hotels easier than they have, specially who use them for the first timeâ€ƒthat people hesitate which hotel to use so we did the hotels feedback to collect all feedbacks and messages in one place.
in our project first you need to sign up if you do not have an account or log in if you have an account already. you can also log in as an admin of the website just if you have the user name and the password.
lets say that everything is fine and you are now in the website then what? let me tell you alittle about it.
we have 5 pages: Home page that contain rating if you like to record your opinion and other people reviews. we have messages page that contain people messages, we have hotels page that contain all feedbacks with its hotel image.
we have add new page to add new hotel name, hotel image and description. finally we hava a dashboard and if you ended your journey in our website you have the option to log out.
